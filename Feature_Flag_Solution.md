# ðŸ§© Multi-Tenant Feature Flag Architecture using Backstage + Unleash OSS

This document outlines a scalable design to manage feature flags in a multi-tenant Integrated Developer Platform (IDP) running on Kubernetes using **Backstage** and **Unleash OSS**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Allow per-app, per-tenant feature flag configuration
- Maintain RBAC for flag visibility and edits
- Leverage Unleash OSS while overcoming its single-project/environment limitation
- Use Backstage as a central developer UI

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

### Per Kubernetes Cluster (IDP Instance)

- One **Unleash OSS** instance
- Feature flags **namespaced** by convention (e.g., `tenant.app.featureName`)
- A **custom UI layer** (possibly a Backstage plugin) for:
  - Authentication and RBAC
  - Tenant-aware and app-aware flag control

```plaintext
Backstage Plugin (or Internal Portal)
    â””â”€â”€> Authenticated UI (RBAC for app/tenant)
          â””â”€â”€> Talks to Unleash OSS API
                â””â”€â”€> Stores all flags (with naming/tag conventions)
```
