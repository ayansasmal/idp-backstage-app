# IDP Platform Integration - Task Documentation

This directory contains the detailed implementation tasks for integrating the Backstage developer portal with the IDP platform.

## Task Categories

### Platform Integration

- [`01-argocd-integration.md`](./01-argocd-integration.md) - ArgoCD application discovery and deployment status
- [`02-argo-workflows-integration.md`](./02-argo-workflows-integration.md) - CI/CD pipeline visibility and workflow management
- [`03-istio-kiali-integration.md`](./03-istio-kiali-integration.md) - Service mesh topology and traffic monitoring
- [`04-kubernetes-integration.md`](./04-kubernetes-integration.md) - Enhanced cluster visibility and resource management
- [`05-gitops-discovery.md`](./05-gitops-discovery.md) - Automatic service discovery from Git repositories

### Monitoring & Observability

- [`06-monitoring-integration.md`](./06-monitoring-integration.md) - Grafana, Prometheus, and Jaeger integration
- [`07-crossplane-integration.md`](./07-crossplane-integration.md) - Infrastructure-as-code visibility and management
- [`08-api-documentation.md`](./08-api-documentation.md) - Enhanced API documentation with validation

### Platform Services

- [`09-platform-entities.md`](./09-platform-entities.md) - Service catalog for IDP platform components
- [`10-aws-cognito-auth.md`](./10-aws-cognito-auth.md) - OIDC authentication and RBAC implementation
- [`11-deployment-infrastructure.md`](./11-deployment-infrastructure.md) - Production deployment and infrastructure

### Developer Experience

- [`12-unleash-integration.md`](./12-unleash-integration.md) - Modern feature flag management with RBAC
- [`13-software-templates.md`](./13-software-templates.md) - Application templates for rapid development
- [`14-workflow-templates.md`](./14-workflow-templates.md) - CI/CD workflow templates for automation
- [`15-documentation-training.md`](./15-documentation-training.md) - Team adoption and training materials

## Quick Start

1. **High Priority**: Start with ArgoCD integration (Task 1) for immediate deployment visibility
2. **Core Platform**: Complete Kubernetes and monitoring integration (Tasks 4, 6)
3. **Developer Experience**: Implement software templates and feature flags (Tasks 13, 12)
4. **Security & Auth**: Deploy AWS Cognito authentication (Task 10)
5. **Full Platform**: Complete remaining integrations based on team needs

## Environment Setup

See [`environment-variables.md`](./environment-variables.md) for required configuration.

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Week 1): ArgoCD and Kubernetes - Immediate deployment visibility
- **Phase 2** (Week 2): Service Mesh and Monitoring - Platform observability
- **Phase 3** (Week 3): Workflow Templates and API docs - Developer automation
- **Phase 4** (Week 4): Authentication and Discovery - Security and service catalog
- **Phase 5** (Week 5): Feature Flags - Advanced developer tools
- **Phase 6** (Week 6): Software Templates - Self-service development
- **Phase 7** (Week 7): Platform Entities and Documentation - Complete integration

## Success Metrics
